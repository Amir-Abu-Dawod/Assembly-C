# Assembly-C
My project centered around understanding the fundamental aspects of computer memory and the execution of programs in machine language. I delved into the intricate nature of assembly language and the role of an assembler in translating symbolic representations into machine code.

The main goal was to develop an assembler program dedicated to converting a specified assembly language into machine code, serving as the initial step before the code can run on hardware. I focused on grasping how computers interpret instructions and data in binary code stored in memory and how the CPU executes machine instructions.

Throughout the project, I navigated through the process of translating a source program written in assembly language into machine code using the assembler tool. While the project encompassed various stages in the program execution path, my primary focus was on developing the assembler program itself.

It was a comprehensive endeavor that allowed me to deepen my understanding of low-level programming, memory organization, and the crucial role of an assembler in the software development process.
